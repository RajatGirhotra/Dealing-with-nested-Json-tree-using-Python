Python script to search for key-value pairs in a nested Json tree


Example file is the nested json file with the name "filetree" and the Python script searches the following in the tree - 

1. Count the total number of files and total number of folders
2. Output a list of files that have the same size
3. Calculate the total size of all files

Note - This is just an example and can be changed accordingly.
